## London Buses and The Javascript Geolocation API

The wonderful people at Transport For London (TFL) recently released (but didn't seem to publicise) a new page on their site that would give you a countdown listing of buses due to arrive at any given stop in London.

This is a micro-repo with a single page to hook into the web service and the world's smallest web proxy to enable cross domain ajax.
